# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Not that good, partly because I would be doing a lot of the pracs in between 4 other classes and 2 jobs so I didn't
always have the means to sit down for a whole hour on one task.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It might have improved based on that my coding efficiency and foresight improved as well as typing speed.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Don't look down on yourself if your actual time was way longer than you estimated for. Also, to read the task more
accurately.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Some reviews had substance to them like being advised to commit more but also did not receive reviews from everyone so
there wasn't always much to go from.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

That everyone walks into this subject with different abilities, sometimes beyond mine. It was nice to see other's
approach to the same problem and where these split or overlap.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 7](https://github.com/tycabassi/cp1404practicals/pull/3#event-15279793671)

### Explanation

Was able to suggest previously learnt concepts that could improve the students work process. Also, I gave examples to
avoid confusion on their side

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 9](https://github.com/MATWILL19/cp1404practicals/pull/7)

### Explanation

I tried to come across as helping instead of telling them what to do, but either using myself as an example or using
suggestive language. Also, I tried my best to be meticulous and recall concepts that we should avoid using in most 
scenarios such as 'while True' statements.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I sometimes felt like that the wording was a bit ambiguous, such as in the testing prac using doctests.. This component
was usually the main absorber of time, and become frustrating at times for someone who is neurodivergent as interpreting
others intentions is beyond my capabilities. I persevered but did struggle and would like to see some clear formatting or
description of the programs. I don't mean for everything to be stepped out line for line, in fact I preferred the pracs
which allowed for personal interpretation, but I am mainly referring to the explanations of installing dependencies,
pull requests or any other exercises that deal with many menus.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Absorbed a lot of the learning, and did a lot of experimentation on the side, either within the project or in console. I
also feel like my effort and attention given to most pracs is something to be proud of. I enjoyed the flow of the pracs
and think it built well on top of each other in a manner that allowed for retaining skills from the previous week without
unnecessary repetition.
