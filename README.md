# CP1404 Practicals

## About this repository

This repository stores the completed practicals components for CP1404. Work was completed by Florian N Eisen entirely
during TR3 in 2024.

## About Me

I am a Engineering student with a big interest for chemistry and curiosity for chemistry which I am studying as well.

## How clean code is constructed:

- Single Responsibility Programming (SRP) ensurtes each component i.e. function of the program controls a single
  function for the program.
- Appropriate error handling philosophy through "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than ask for Permission (EAFP)" or "Look
  Before You Leap (LBYL)".
- Use PEP 8 formatting and semantics as proposed by Python's founder himself Guido van Rossum.

The PEP can be found [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
